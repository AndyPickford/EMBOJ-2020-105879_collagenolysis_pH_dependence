# EMBOJ-2020-105879_collagenolysis_pH_dependence
 Raw and processed data for the manuscript "Insights into the collagenolytic mechanism of MMP-1 from trapping the enzyme in its compact state".
 
- This repository contains 4 folders (one for each MMP-1 variant studied) together with a summary MS Excel file ("") for the collaegnolysis pH dependence study.
- Each MMP-1 variant folder contains raw data (in the "red", "green" or "blue" subfolders) for the triplicate assays together with corresponding macro-enabled Excel files used for curve-fitting and analysis of the SDS-PAGE gel slices.
- The "red"/"green"/"blue" subfolders contain further subfolders ("A", "B", "C") for technical replicate images (.bmp files) of the SDS-PAGE gels and the raw digitised lanes (files "0.txt" - "14.txt").
